At game end:
if achievement is made at game end the pop up still shows behind the game end GetAttribute
It should be postponed/hidden. 

The Game Over ui should have a button to either take player to lobby or rematch?

ideas:
turret to defend. 
damage shield.
harder achievements.
traps
speed ups
attractivness player (animals follows) animal lover
improve looks for animals
