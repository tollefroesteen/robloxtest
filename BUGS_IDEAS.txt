At game end:
if achievement is made at game end the pop up still shows behind the game end GetAttribute
It should be postponed/hidden. 

The Game Over ui should have a button to either take player to lobby or rematch?

ideas:
turret to defend. 
damage shield.
harder achievements.
traps
speed ups
attractivness player (animals follows) animal lover
improve looks for animals

--- FIXED ---
- Team shirt color not applying correctly on game restart (fixed: connection tracking)
- Coin counter showing higher than expected (was achievement bonus - clarified in UI)
- MINIMUM_LOSER_COINS missing from GameEndConfig (added: 5 coins minimum)
- Team abandonment/forfeit now properly handles winner determination
