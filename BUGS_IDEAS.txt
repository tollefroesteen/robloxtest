At game end:
if achievement is made at game end the pop up still shows behind the game end GetAttribute
It should be postponed/hidden. 

The Game Over ui should have a button to either take player to lobby or rematch?

ideas:
turret to defend. 
damage shield.
harder achievements.
traps
speed ups
attractivness player (animals follows) animal lover
improve looks for animals

--- FIXED ---
- Team shirt color not applying correctly on game restart (fixed: connection tracking)
- Coin counter showing higher than expected (was achievement bonus - clarified in UI)
- MINIMUM_LOSER_COINS missing from GameEndConfig (added: 5 coins minimum)
- Team abandonment/forfeit now properly handles winner determination


The AnimalTemplate.rbxmx is the currently used representation of an animal. It has hirearchy/construction that is tied to an animation system. We would like to have every animal defined in the AnimationLibraryModule to have a a unique look. Can you provide different looks and feel by consturction body parts based on primitives or other ways that would look like animal bodypart that make the amimal qute or intersting but still fitt the same structure as the AnimalTemplate.rbxmx. Then the animals in the AnimalLibraryModule could have a property that points to what template they should be using. 


Shield should be damageable 
Lucky blocks - blocks of different types that contain different chance of spawning animals
Buy lucky blocks
Shots along ground
Shots that scare animals on impact
Scare and shots should damange shield
Unshielded gets player shocked using scare
XP counter more dynamically and allways happening

Bug: Both lucky blocks and gifts spawned by the UFO tend to get stuck in the GetAttribute
Bug: Some animals spawn under the terrain when the UFO spawns them
