# Game Roadmap: **Shepherd Showdown**

A roadmap outlining planned features, systems, and development phases for the Roblox game.

---

## 🎮 **Game Overview**
Players take the role of space‑shepherds guiding various animal species into their cages. Each species has unique behaviors and score values. A UFO roams above the game arena, occasionally spawning new animals. The goal is to gather animals efficiently within the time limit—highest score wins.

Winning players/teams earn the species they collected in their **Animal Index**, a persistent history of discovered/captured species.
